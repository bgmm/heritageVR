              Design is a way of representation, organizing ideas in an intuitively and cognitively as is problem-solving.
              In that sense, design mediums and tools come into prominence to determine the cognitive abilities of
              designers, particularly the novice designers. Nevertheless, not every technology provides designers a
              convenient medium to explore, think, and design naturally. In this study, we investigate the cognitive
              abilities of the novice designers in the context of shape representation methods within the possibilities
              of two different design mediums and tools. At first, we conducted a shape exploration exercise to
              generate the 3D model pieces from the facade of the Dark Church in Cappadocia. And then, we used the
              3D model pieces in a shape representation exercise to observe the seeing, imagining, and acting abilities
              of novice designers in computer and virtual reality (VR) environment. The main goal of the study is to
              observe the cognitive process of first-year architecture students in different 3D design environments
              while they are seeing, perceiving, and discovering the shapes and sub shape relations with the help of
              the two different 3D modeling tools. In the context of this study, we assumed that the shapes the novice
              designers recognize are initially in 3D so that they would perceive the shape relations better in a 3D
              environment. Thus, they can offer creative shape representations in both computer and VR
              environments. Since the utilization of the tools has more effect on them, the ability to use the different
              tools and the ability to have control over the devices have more influence on the results than shape
              representations of the facade. We conclude that architectural design students focus on shape representation in the VR environment better than in the computer environment. And as a result, they
              work efficiently and interact more with the 3D model.</p>

                Introduction

              <p class="font-size-lg text-black mb-6 mb-md-8">
                Design is an inherent human cognitive ability that consists of a series of critical decisions in an iterative and highly complex process responsive to many factors (Cross et al, 1992). It can be considered as a transformation problem like other problem-solving activities (Eastman, 1968). The ultimate objective of the design process is the production of visual representations of the designed entity with enough completion and coherence to allow its construction or the construction of a visual simulation of it, physically or mentally (Goldschmidt, 1991). The transformation of the ideas and thoughts in designers’ minds into the visual representations is at the core of the whole design process. However, the ability to transfer thoughts efficiently requires knowledge and practice.

                The level of knowledge underlines visual-spatial (Bilda & Gero, 2005) or visual-mental (Oxman, 1997) cognitive ability for identification, generation, and integration processes of 2D shape recognition, 3D modeling, or transitions between 2D to 3D shape representation medium and tools. Changes between each medium and tools are difficult for designers, particularly for novice designers, with under-developed spatial thinking skills.

                The shape representation mediums and tools that are available today are mostly based on 2D representation techniques, although the shapes we perceive and interact are in 3D. The investigation of the shape representation for novice designers through visual-spatial cognitive ability is the main motivation of this study as the novice designers think and design in 3D design mediums.

                The main goal of the study is to observe the cognitive process of first-year architecture students in different 3D design environments while they are seeing, perceiving, and discovering the shapes and sub shape relations with the help of the two different 3D modeling tools. Possible new combinations will occur depending on the shape discoveries from the students. In the end, the capacity and ability to transform knowledge into the representational outcomes will be defined by emphasizing the perceptual and physical actions of the students.

                In the first part of the study, we collected architectural information on the Dark Church (Karanlık Kilise) to understand and interpret the form of the facade. Since most of the facade is missing today, it was necessary to find out any instructions on the original state of the facade. After that, we asked ten masters and Ph.D. students in the Architectural Design Computing Program at Istanbul Technical University (ITU) to break the facade into pieces like a puzzle as a shape exploration exercise. Next, we created the abstract model pieces of the facade related to the data provided from the shape exploration exercise. Then, we placed the model pieces in a file as a Rhinoceros document and as a VR scene in Microsoft Maquette software. In the end, we conducted a pilot study with four first-year architecture students at ITU to bring the model pieces together like a 3D puzzle in the computer and virtual reality environment as the shape representation exercise.
